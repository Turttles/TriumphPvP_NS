# TriumphPvP_NS
Nether Spawner plugin for TriumphPvP


Request: 

A plugin that disables the silking of natural generated nether spawners, but still allows for user spawners that were placed to be silked. 

You can use the permission node tpvp.spawners.override to override (for admins, etc.).


If you have any questions, contact Turttles#7920 on discord.
